# Network Backup Experience

## Description

This experience is designed to facilitate the automated backup of network configurations using Ansible. It provides a streamlined way to seed the necessary resources and create, manage, and execute backup tasks, ensuring that network configurations are safely stored and can be easily restored if needed.

## What This Experience Covers

This experience includes the following key components:

### Project Templates

- **Backup Project Template**: Defined within the `setup.yaml` playbook, this template helps organize and manage all necessary components for the network backup experience. It ensures that relevant files, roles, and configurations are logically arranged, making it easier to maintain and execute automation tasks.

### Job Templates

- **Create Full Backup Job Template**: Pre-configured to execute the network backup playbook, streamlining the process of creating full backups of network configurations.
- **Create Differential Backup Job Template**: Pre-configured to execute the network backup playbook, streamlining the process of creating differential backups when differences exist between the running configuration and previous backups.

### Playbooks

- **Playbooks**: Located in the playbooks directory, these scripts are specifically designed to connect to network devices, retrieve configuration data, and store it in a designated backup location.

### Surveys

- **Backup Surveys**: Defined within the `backup.j2` file, backup surveys provide a dynamic interaction mechanism for users to specify parameters for the backup jobs. These surveys enable users to:
  - Choose the type of backup to be created (full, diff)

## Resources Created by This Experience

1. **Project Templates**
    - Ensure that all relevant files, roles, and configurations are logically arranged, facilitating easier maintenance and execution of automation tasks.

2. **Job Templates**
    - Outline the necessary parameters and configurations to perform network backups using the provided playbooks.

## How to Use
